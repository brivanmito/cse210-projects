// Showing Creativity and Exceeding Requirements
// 1. Think of other problems that keep people from writing in their journal and address one of those.
     // * One of the issues why people don't keep a diary is because they feel they have nothing to say, which may tempt them not to write in their diary.
     // * The application has many validations where it verifies that the input is a non-empty string of text, so the user will be more motivated to write because they cannot save anything until they answer the prompt.

// 2. Save other information in the journal entry.
     // * I found it necessary to save the time when the user writes in their diary, so they can know based on saved entries which time is better for them to write

// 3. Improve the process of saving and loading to save as a .csv file that could be opened in Excel (make sure to account for quotation marks and commas correctly in your content.
     // * "I used the TextFieldParser class, which is part of the Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO library in C#. 
    //      This class helped me with reading CSV files that contain double quotes (""). In my program, when a user 
    //      enters an input that contains commas (,), the program saves it in the .csv file as follows: 
    //      "Hello, My name is Bryan". Therefore, when I tried to read it conventionally with the separator (,), 
    //      it would split the input into several fields. The TextFieldParser class allowed me to read files, 
    //      regardless of whether they have commas in the input. This allows them to be opened correctly in Excel."

// Colors: I used colors in the menu, and I also set the color Magenta for all user inputs
// The prompts are not repeated during the program's execution.

// Handling Errors: 
//          Menu Otions: The program has a numerical options menu. If a user enters a letter or string, it alerts.
//             them that there was an error and prompts them to enter a new option, but it must be a number within the menu
//          Try / Catch: Capture the exception that occurs when a requested file, whose name was provided by the user, does not exist
