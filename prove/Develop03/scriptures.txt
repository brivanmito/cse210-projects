Matthew 11:28-30 # Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest; Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls; For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
John 3:2-3 # Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is; And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
